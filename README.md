### General Information

This privacy policy applies to all information used while using our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.
Information/ Data we collect

All data you enter while using our Apps are only stored locally on the device, except for iCloud features which you might use in certain apps.

Our apps do not transmit any of the data entered, which includes your personal information (including Name, email address, phone number, etc.), to us - nor do we have any access to the information you enter on your device. In fact our apps do not contact us at all.
We also do not operate any server or database infrastructure to store any data.


**iCloud**

Our Apps store some of your data in Appleâ€™s iCloud service, for example to enable a sync feature between multiple devices signed into your Apple ID etc. None of that information is sent to us nor do we have access to it. Please refer to Apple Privacy policy to get more information in iCloud.


### E-Mail Contact

In case you contact us via E-Mail with a question or support request, we obviously have access to your e-mail address. This name/ e-mail address is not used for anything else than replying to your message. 


**Newsletters**

We do not send any newsletters.



### 3rd Parties

Our Apps are using features offered by Apple on their platform.
Upon downloading and using our applications, Apple may collect personal data in accordance with their Privacy Policy.


### Payments

We may provide paid products and/or in-app purchases within our Apps. In that case, we use the Apple environment for payment processing (including the payment method you entered for your Apple account). We do not have direct access to this information and therefore cannot store or collect any of your payment details. That information is provided directly to Apple whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy.


### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, in part or in whole. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page and are indicated by the revised date.
